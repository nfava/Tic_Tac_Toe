Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game!

Players can enter the spot choice through the console. 
The Grid or game baord works as so:

1,2,3
4,5,6
7,8,9

Like Any Tic-Tac-Toe game 
In order to win either player must connect three in a row.

If you see the other player close to connecting 3, you must block it! 

The game will end in a tie, if the board is filled and no one has connected 3.
